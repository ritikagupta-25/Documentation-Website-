          JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Date , and Math , and a core set of language
          elements such as operators, control structures, and statements. core JavaScript be extended for a variety of
          purposes by supplementing it additional object; for example:
        <ul>
          <li>
            client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supp objects to control a browser and its Document
            Object Mode For example, client-side extensions allow an application elements on html form and respond to
